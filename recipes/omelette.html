    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What can you really say that would make this omelette stand out from the rest? Nothing, really. It's just a basic omelette with maybe some extra spices. Though, I don't really add milk to mine, mostly 'cause my stomache would hate me for it.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty basic, and that's quite alright with me</p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil (could replace with meat fat from cooking)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>spices (optional)</li>
            <li>other add-ins like spinach (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        

        <ol>
            <li>Crack open the eggs.</li>
            <li>Add your salt and pepper to taste and any other spice(s) you're feeling at the time.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Add your leafy green veg here so they don't completely desintigrate in the pan.</li>
            <li>Heat pan to medium heat.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Cook your chopped meat, like bacon, leaving everything in the pan.</li>
            <li>Add your eggs (just after your meat is done, if added) and cook until you have a pancake looking solid (about 3 minutes), then flip carefully to finish cooking.</li>
            <li>Plate up, add your favorite sauce (I like Chipotle Tabasco!), and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
