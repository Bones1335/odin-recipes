    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This curry is a very simple recipe that can be made in a large pan for about 3-4 people to enjoy. That is, unless you're cooking for yourself, in which case leftovers for quite a few meals!</p>

        <p>The base of the curry is saut√©ed onions in olive oil with the spices added just after browning. Then, add in your other desired ingredients, letting them mix with the spices. And finally, top it all off with some cocnut cream and water to create that delicious curry sauce. Plate it all up with a bed of rice, and enjoy a wonderful party in your mouth!</p>
